<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p style = "font-size:20px">My Senior research project will be a performance comparison between SQL and NoSQL Database management systems in order to find where they are most beneficial as well as where they may be deficient for certain tasks and queries. I plan on using YCSB (Yahoo Cloud Server Benchmark) for my comparison between the two.</p>
